# NOW TV React Interview

![NowTV](./logo.png)

A React and Redux project to retrieve, render and manipulate data returned from an API.

## Commands

- **yarn start**: Runs the web application in developer mode
- **yarn test**: Executes Jest tests that have the `.test.js` extension

## Project Structure

Feel free to create new files to help you complete these tasks. Additional dependencies can be installed, if you think they are necessary.

* `src/index.js` is your react entry point, it is connected to the redux store

* `data` directory is a mocked-API which exposes methods to get message information and member information from a chat room.
It has two publicly exposed functions `getMessages` and `getMembers`.

* Your tasks will be to add further logic to display and manipulate the data returned from these functions, without modifying `data/index.js`.  Code addition should be unit tested.

## Tasks 

1. Render the list of messages from the redux store

2. Display the user's email when you hover over the message - how can you achieve this in both CSS and JavaScript ?

3. Display the avatar of the user next to the message

4. Display and format the timestamp of the message to be in a human readable format, e.g. `1st Jan 2020 17:00`

5. Sort the messages by time

## Additional Tasks 

1. How could you improve the accessibility of your website?

2. Enhance the solution by rendering the user's name under the message. Once clicked it will take you through to a grid page showing all the user's messages:

    * Display the title of the message
    
    * Display and format the timestamp of the message to be human readable, e.g. `1st Jan 2020 17:00`

3. Can you make sure the design of your website is responsive?

4. How would you go about automating and testing your application?

## Submission

Please upload your solution to your github account as a public repository, and send the URL to us.
